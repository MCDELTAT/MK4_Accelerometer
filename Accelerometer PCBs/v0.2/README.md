## Prusa MK4 Accelerometer v0.2

ðŸ›‘ Status: Design complete, have ordered PCBs, have not tried on a real printer.

This board design fixes a large error made in the last revision, namely, the pinout is correct for a stock cable purchased from Digikey. Thus you should be able to buy cables from them, and immediately plug it into your printer. I also moved a silkscreen around the LIS2DH chip for hopefully better visual alignment. Finally, as reported in issue #1 of the repo, a 2.2K may be added to make this circuit compatible with 0.3.7 and 0.4.4 boards.

This is the bare minimum reference circuit as provided by STMicroelectronics, with an LED for reference.

When aligning the LIS2DHTR by hand, make sure the circle is in the top right corner, matching the stars near the LGA-12 pads.
